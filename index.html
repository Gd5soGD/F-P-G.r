<center> Welcome to Developments-0.1 </center>
<pre>
 
 
<pre>
hey, I see you came to our website now if your here that means that either you're from discord or someone recommended us,  so welcome! I say you see our options for making Games so... ye have fun!
</pre> 
<pre>
Welcome to Now if you want to make a game with us you have three options 
1) work with Gd5So paying only 15% of the copyrights to the game 
 (Gd5So is best if looking for a  big game like sandbox RPG or open-world  or if you want small horror games)
 
 2)work with the C.P's Company paying also 15% of the copy right's  (there best if looking for a big horror game or indie in general great for Fnaf games and is very much one of the best horror game creator's)
 
 3)or you can work with both teams and have to pay 50% of the copy right's (it's much faster and better for Bigger more complex games)
 
</pre>
 
 <p> Now we have created many games and we're working on many other's right now!<br>so why don't you go ahead and download some, see what we do?
*COMEING SOON* </p>
 
 <p> ok so please give us your discord name # and <br> 
then write the summary of you'r game (please let it be under 200 words) </p>
